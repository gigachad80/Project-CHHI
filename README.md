#### Project-CSHI : All in one Cyber crime complaint and security portal for all countries ( International ) 

### 📌 Overview


 *_Project-CHHI_* is your essential global hub for reporting cybercrimes. Navigating the right channels can be complex, so I've brought together all critical portals, especially official government resources, from all 195 countries into one convenient location. Whether you've experienced phishing, fraud, or identity theft, easily find and access the appropriate platform to file your complaint. Simply select or search your country, browse the curated list, and choose the portal that best suits your needs to report the incident effectively.

### 🤔 Why This Name?

Project - C(Cyber) H(Helping) H(Hub) I(Iternational). 

Also you can say it as an International version of [Project-CSHI](https://project-cshi.netlify.app/) which is also developed by me🫠


### ⌚ Total Time taken to develop & test

 4 hour 5 min

### 🙃Why I Created This

 I created this collection of portals for you to have a single, convenient place to access different government resources for reporting various types of crime and online issues.

Instead of having to search for each specific portal individually (like the cybercrime portal, for reporting morphed photos, the one for lost phones, or the one for financial fraud), you can find them all listed together.
